## <center> Analysis of Qushuojingying English </center>
### 1 Brief introduction
#### &#8195;&#8195;Qushuoyingyu is an application which can satisfy your need of English speaking.
### 2 About recruit model
#### &#8195;&#8195;Recruit model（闯关模式）is based on the theory of behaviourism. whose process is  that through repeated English conversation training. behavior is firstly affected, and then through frequent intensive training, knowledge and experience are constructed.

#### Environment  
&#8195;&#8195;Learners can start and complete their learning and practice wherever or whenever they want in recruit model by Qushuojingying application. They just need to use their smart phone and connect with WIFI to download our Qushuojingying application. We consider that environment include the factors of interact object and interaction. Because both of the interact object and interaction appeared in our typical application and support user to interact.  

#### Interact object
&#8195;&#8195;in the recruit model, the object of interaction with learner is mainly machines. Learners through continuous dialogue with the machine, to complete the task.  

#### Interaction
&#8195;&#8195;the human-machine interaction includes dialogue, watching, touching etc. through this element, learner can receive stimulus (level and ranking) from machine.  

#### Behavior
&#8195;&#8195;in the theory of behaviourism, due to repeated training, the first element to be changed is behavior. In the app, when learners practice a content repeatedly, their dialogue patterns and pronunciation will gradually form a specific behavior of their own. In the line from interaction to behavior, the learner's reaction corresponding to the stimulus is completing the task. And in this process, the reaction will have a certain degree of influence on the behavior. as the final part of the loop, the feedback training scores from machine will help learner further strengthen.

#### Knowledge,Skills,Attitude
&#8195;&#8195;Knowledge: Learners go through various levels, including classroom, office, hospital and other scenarios to learn oral communication vocabulary, special grammar, specific expression sentence patterns, as well as mouth and pronunciation standards.

&#8195;&#8195;Skills: Learners practice in a variety of scenarios such as classroom, office, hospital and so on, to improve their speaking and listening skills.

&#8195;&#8195;Attitude: Learners overcome the psychological pressure of "difficult to speak" and develop a sense of courage in fluent oral communication on nervous occasions. And also learners will build confidence in speaking and learning English.

#### Experience
&#8195;&#8195;Through continuous behavioral reinforcement, the memory of pronunciation, mouth shapes and intonation can be acquired, as well as the memory of listening, speaking and watching in different oral communication scenes. In addition, the operational memory can be formed by continuous use of our Qushuojingying software. In addition, learners will feel a sense of accomplishment after completing each level, which further stimulates learners’ interest and motivation to continue to learn oral English.

&#8195;&#8195;In general, the recruit model based on behaviorism learning theory is using level as a stimulus to let learners conduct repeated training, and taking the completion of task as a reaction to achieve the purpose of constructing new behaviors. Afterwards, in the process of continuous feedback and consolidation, learners can internalize and form their own knowledge construction.  

### 3 About optional model
#### &#8195;&#8195;optional model (自选模式) is based on the theory of constructivism, which emphasize collaboration with real people or machine to build and construct new knowledge.

#### Environment
&#8195;&#8195; People can complete their learning and practice wherever they are. they only need to use their smart phone and connect with WIFI to download our application. We consider that environment include the factors of interact object and interaction. Because both the interact object and interaction appeared in our typical application and support user to interact.
#### About user
&#8195;&#8195; everyone has pre-knowledge before they start to use our application to learn. For example, speaking skill and listening skill already existed in their memory.
#### Interact object
&#8195;&#8195; In the optional mode, users can choose to interact with real people or machine, so there are human-human interact object or human-machine interact object.
#### Experience
&#8195;&#8195; Within the interaction and communication process, users can produce some experience like feeling of communication and collaboration with co-peer, which would integrate with their pre-knowledge and memory to impact their next interaction and collaboration process.
