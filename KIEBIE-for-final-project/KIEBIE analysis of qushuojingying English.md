## <center> Analysis of Qushuojingying English </center>
### 1 Brief introduction
#### &#8195;&#8195;Qushuoyingyu is an application which can satisfy your need of English speaking.
### 2 About recruit model
#### &#8195;&#8195;Recruit model（闯关模式）is based on the theory of behaviourism. whose process is  that through repeated English conversation training. behavior is firstly affected, and then through frequent intensive training, knowledge and experience are constructed.

#### Environment  
&#8195;&#8195;People can complete their learning and practice wherever they are. they only need to use their smart phone and connect with WIFI to download our application. We consider that environment include the factors of interact object and interaction. Because both the interact object and interaction appeared in our typical application and support user to interact.  

#### Interact object
&#8195;&#8195;in the recruit model, the object of interaction with learner is mainly machines. Learners through continuous dialogue with the machine, to complete the task.  

#### Interaction
&#8195;&#8195;the human-machine interaction includes dialogue, watching, touching etc. through this element, learner can receive stimulus (level and ranking) from machine.  

#### Behavior
&#8195;&#8195;in the theory of behaviourism, due to repeated training, the first element to be changed is behavior. In the app, when learners practice a content repeatedly, their dialogue patterns and pronunciation will gradually form a specific behavior of their own. In the line from interaction to behavior, the learner's reaction corresponding to the stimulus is completing the task. And in this process, the reaction will have a certain degree of influence on the behavior. as the final part of the loop, the feedback training scores from machine will help learner further strengthen.  

&#8195;&#8195;In general, the recruit model based on behaviorism learning theory is using level as a stimulus to let learners conduct repeated training, and taking the completion of task as a reaction to achieve the purpose of constructing new behaviors. Afterwards, in the process of continuous feedback and consolidation, learners can internalize and form their own knowledge construction.  

### 3 About optional model
#### &#8195;&#8195;optional model (自选模式) is based on the theory of constructivism, which emphasize collaboration with real people or machine to build and construct new knowledge.
