**Analysis of KEKE English**  
  
**0、	Brief Introduction about KEKE English**    
  
>**1 Environment**    
   >>**1.1 Analysis**  
   Ubiquitous learning is an important way of learning in life-long learning society. The development of information technology provides a broader space for ubiquitous learning[1]. More and more people tend to adopt E-learning to achieve life-long learning. Informal learning communities based on network can solve the problem existing in traditional learning, such as time and space limited, using resources difficulty[2]. 
Learners are pleased to learn in an informal learning environment that is not limited by time or place. To meet learner’s needs best, KEKE English has made some efforts and it has great advantages in learning environment, mainly including space flexible, time freedom.  

   >>**1.1.1 Space flexible**   
   As an E-learning platform, KEKE English enables learners to study everywhere. It has two forms：APP or PC, and the two can keep data synchronization. For graduates, they can use it what matter they are in the classroom, library or dormitory; for the middle school students, they can participate in on-line courses after school. And for the people who must go to work, they can acquire knowledge from KEKE English during the lunch break or after work, or just before they go to bed, which all make study become more flexible

   >>**1.1.2 Time freedom**   
  Learners don’t have to study it at a regular time. They can make good use of their fragmented time. For example, when they are waiting in line in cafeteria or when they are waiting for a bus, they can all read English article or remember word. What's more,  if they come across words or sentences that they can't understand in daily life or study, they can use KEKE English to translate it in time.

   >>**1.2 Suggestion**  
   **Simplify official website:**  As shown in our questionnaire, there are still a certain percentage of people using computer to study. But the official website of KEKE English is too messy, lacking the key points, and just like advertisement.

 >**5 Experience**    
   >>**5.1 Analysis**  
   TheGlossary of Education Reform funded by Nellie Mae EducationFoundation defines learning experience roughly: learning experience refers to the experience generated by students' interaction with courses, teaching activities, teaching interaction and learning environment in the learning process .The learning experience of e-learning platform: learners' perception and reflection of the platform learning environment, learning activities, learning services, effect and many other learning elements and platform construction . We used a questionnaire to investigate the functions that learners think keke English can improve their learning experience. We will combine subjective cognition and objective data to evaluate the learning experience brought by coco English from the aspects of accessibility, availability and happiness to evaluate.
 
   >>**5.1.1 Accessibility** 
    Massive learning content and covering a wide range of content. Keke English have a lots of materials about videos, articles, words bank and so on. Most of the content is free, and even paid or VIP services can earn “cocoa beans” for exchanging materials.  
    The classification of the learning content on the homepage is detailed, and learners can choose these different materials according to the needs and purposes of learning.  
    The computer phone can synchronize the vocabulary, the collection record and the browsing history, but the learning progress of the Android system and the ios system are not synchronized. For example, the user has completed 200 levels in the Android system. After switching to the ios system, the user need to re-start from scratch, which seriously affects the user’s learning experience.  
    The mobile phone system environment is unstable. For example, the latest version of ios can't log in the account, and sometimes this app don’t recognize the phone connected wifi.   
    However, some functions are not set to be self-contained. For example, the number of words in the task of memorizing words is set by the system, each level of 15 words, so the users cannot modify by themselves.  
    
   >>**5.1.2 Availability**   
     The effectiveness of keke English is mainly analyzes from learning and test results and learning feedback.   
     From the comments of the software store, we find that many learners think that the content of coco English is rich in content, and can be used to train listening, speaking, reading and writing skills, in order to improve the overall English ability.  
     Keke English has an Intelligent English scoring system, which can test leaner’s listening and speaking skill and give scores to test their learning performance. But this test feedback system is enough, perhaps the corresponding error correction scheme should be presented here.  
     
   >>**5.1.3 Happiness**  
   Happiness refers to the feeling of learners during and after the learning.  
   In this respect, keke English has set up an incentive mechanism to help learners enhance their sense of achievement in learning. For example, after going though mission twice, the user can punch the card to earn “cocoa beans”, which can be used to exchange VIP, courses and so on. In addition, users can view the ranking from the list and interact with other users, which can stimulate their desire to challenge and promote continuous learning.  
   In terms of content settings, coco English set a lot of interesting learning materials. Such as, radio blogs, bilingual video, movies and songs. Thses can attract learners' attention through speech skills and video music, and improve the happiness of the learning process to enhance the learning effect.  
   
   >>**5.2 Suggestion**  
   We have also conducted a questionnaire survey on the user's learning experience. The above are the directions in which learners think keke English will reduce their learning experience. Based on these directions and the analysis of our group, the following Suggestions are given.  
   
   >>**5.2.1 strengthen the part that users can set**
   Because each person's learning ability and habits are different, so it is suggested the maximum degree of autonomy, let learners set learning plan, so that learners can control the learning progress by themselves.  
   
   >>**5.2.2 ensure a stable environment**   
   In this respect, keke English is required to test the system environment, and fix various bugs such as flashback, cotton and so on.  
   
   >>**5.2.3 optimize interface design**   
   There is a lot of learning content and enter windows. However, from the survey, there are still a quarter of people think that the interface design of kek English is not friendly, which is related to the excessive resources and the multiple and disorderly functions of the home page. The functions of keke English can be classified on the home page, which will make the learners look more clear at a glance.  
   
   >>**5.2.4 feedback method** 
   The testing mechanism of keke English is very simple. We suggest giving learners some Suggestions after the test to help them further improve.  
   
>**6 interact objectt**    
   >>**6.1 Analysis**     
   The interaction objects of e-learning platform are divided into human-computer interaction and human-human interaction. These two interaction modes are very necessary and irreplaceable. In this chapter, we combine the questionnaire survey of learners on interaction to evaluate the functional characteristics of human-machine interaction and human-human interaction, and give some useful Suggestions.  
  
   >>**6.1.1 human-machine interaction** 
   The main technology in human-machine interaction is speech recognition, which is used to identify learners' spoken language and give scores. Keke English let students to choose the degree of difficulty, purpose of learning etc, and recommend learning resources suitable for learners’ level according to these options. But for keke English in terms of human-machine interaction, its unilateral output of knowledge is more, and its design of keke English is less. 
   
   >>**6.1.2 human-human interaction**   
   In the part of human-human interaction, The main interaction objects are teachers and similar learners in keke English. Interaction with teachers mainly use the function of class. Interaction with learners frequently use discussion groups and dynamic to interact. These functions can simulate the real classroom environment.  
   The function of class is expounded in the section of interaction, so that won't be covered again here. In the learner interaction, learners can discuss relevant knowledge in a discussion group, which is the same as forum. Dynamic is similar to WeChat circle of friends, which is used to show the results after punching in. However, the dynamic function only opens the "like" function, and cannot comment.  
   According to the results of the questionnaire, keke English has a relatively poor design of interaction. Sixty percent had little or no interaction, and those who interacted had a "average" attitude about its function.
   
   >>**6.2 Suggestion**  
   >>**6.2.1 add the function of comment**  
   the effect of user interaction in the "dynamic" function is not obvious enough. Comment function can be added to enable users who have taken the same course to have two-way communication.   
   
   >>**6.2.2 increase interactive encouragement mechanism**  
   For example, for encouraging learners to interact and creating a positive learning atmosphere, cocoa beans can be awarded to learners who have received more than 20 likes.
