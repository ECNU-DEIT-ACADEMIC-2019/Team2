  #### &#8195;&#8195;First of all, our group used questionnaire survey the users’ usage scenarios, user experience, learning effect and so on about KEKE English. Then, we combine the questionnaire survey result, from the Environment, Knowledge, Skills, Attitude, behaviors, Interaction, Experience, Interact object six aspects to introduction and analysis KEKE English product, and put forward the corresponding improvements.
 

 ----------------------------------------    
>**1 Environment**    
   >>**1.1 Analysis**  
  #### &#8195;&#8195;Ubiquitous learning is an important way of learning in life-long learning society. The development of information technology provides a broader space for ubiquitous learning[1]. More and more people tend to adopt E-learning to achieve life-long learning. Informal learning communities based on network can solve the problem existing in traditional learning, such as time and space limited, using resources difficulty[2]. 
#### &#8195;&#8195;Learners are pleased to learn in an informal learning environment that is not limited by time or place. To meet learner’s needs best, KEKE English has made some efforts and it has great advantages in learning environment, mainly including space flexible, time freedom.  

   >>**1.1.1 Space flexible**   
  #### &#8195;&#8195;As an E-learning platform, KEKE English enables learners to study everywhere. It has two forms：APP or PC, and the two can keep data synchronization. For graduates, they can use it what matter they are in the classroom, library or dormitory; for the middle school students, they can participate in on-line courses after school. And for the people who must go to work, they can acquire knowledge from KEKE English during the lunch break or after work, or just before they go to bed, which all make study become more flexible

<div align="center"><img src="https://github.com/ECNU-DEIT-ACADEMIC-2019/Team2/blob/master/images/environment-7.jpg" height="180" width="480" > </div>  

   >>**1.1.2 Time freedom**   
 #### &#8195;&#8195;Learners don’t have to study it at a regular time. They can make good use of their fragmented time. For example, when they are waiting in line in cafeteria or when they are waiting for a bus, they can all read English article or remember word. What's more,  if they come across words or sentences that they can't understand in daily life or study, they can use KEKE English to translate it in time.   

<div align="center"><img src="https://github.com/ECNU-DEIT-ACADEMIC-2019/Team2/blob/master/images/environment-2.jpg" height="280" width="150"/>         <img src="https://github.com/ECNU-DEIT-ACADEMIC-2019/Team2/blob/master/images/environment-3.jpg" height="280" width="150"/></div>  

   >>**1.2 Suggestion**  
  #### &#8195;&#8195;**Simplify official website:**  As shown in our questionnaire, there are still a certain percentage of people using computer to study. But the official website of KEKE English is too messy, lacking the key points, and just like advertisement.  

<div align="center"><img src="https://github.com/ECNU-DEIT-ACADEMIC-2019/Team2/blob/master/images/environment-4.jpg" height="180" width="480" > </div>

 ----------------------------------------     
 >**2 Knowledge，Skill and Attitude**    
   >>**2.1 Analysis**  
  ####  &#8195;&#8195;E-learning platform designer need to consider what will the learner learn. Maybe they learn knowledge、skills or some attitude. The goals that meet the principle : zone of proximal development, can inspire learning behavior most. Junchen Ma believes that in order to ensure the continuous role of self-efficacy in the online learning process, the setting of learning goals should be clear, specific and moderately difficult[3] The research shows that the teaching objectives setting according to learners' own specific situation can be better to stimulate learners' learning motivation and achieve more better learning effect[4]. Online English learning should recommend suitable learning resources for learners based on their pre-planned time requirements, and aiming at learners' preference for different types of learning resources and adaptability to the difficulty level of learning resources[5].   
  #### &#8195;&#8195;As an online English learning platform, KEKE English meets the learning needs of people who are with different position and English levels. As the chart shows, KEKE English is a multi-functional English learning software. And it provides supports for learners to learn language knowledge, language skills, or enhance emotional attitudes of English.  
   
<div align="center"><img src="https://github.com/ECNU-DEIT-ACADEMIC-2019/Team2/blob/master/images/environment-8.jpg" height="200" width="480" > </div>  

   >>**2.1.1 Support language knowledge learning**   
####   &#8195;&#8195;Pronunciation, vocabulary and grammar are the basis and guarantee of mastering a language systematically. For language learning, knowledge mastery refers to learners' mastery of common grammar, vocabulary and discourse structure. Some efforts have been made in language, vocabulary and grammar by KEKE English.  
   #### **（1）Various pronunciation exercises**   
####   &#8195;&#8195;KEKE English has rich practice of pronunciation, including“Practice pronunciation every day”、“English pronunciation lecture”、“The word pronunciation of words that easy to read wrong”、“Phonetic symbol formula memory” , etc. That all help students to learn basic English pronunciation more quickly.  
 
 <div align="center"><img src="https://github.com/ECNU-DEIT-ACADEMIC-2019/Team2/blob/master/images/environment-9.jpg" height="200" width="480" > </div>  
<div align="center"><img src="https://github.com/ECNU-DEIT-ACADEMIC-2019/Team2/blob/master/images/environment-10.jpg" height="200" width="480" > </div>  

  ####  **（2）Rich in vocabulary**   
 ####  &#8195;&#8195;The recitation module of KEKE English has some advantages: rich vocabulary, various recitation mode and interaction. Firstly, KEKE English has much word-book for all grades, such as primary school、CET、Ielts、toefl, etc. Secondly, its word-book is not only a comprehensive collection of words, the interpretation to a word is accurate. And it provides roots、synonyms to help the students to learn.  
 
 <div align="center"><img src="https://github.com/ECNU-DEIT-ACADEMIC-2019/Team2/blob/master/images/environment-11.jpg" height="280" width="150"/>         <img src="https://github.com/ECNU-DEIT-ACADEMIC-2019/Team2/blob/master/images/environment-12.jpg" height="280" width="150"/></div>  
 
 ####  &#8195;&#8195;In the process of word learning, students tend to be unable to concentrate because of the way of rote learning. Subject teaching makes students understand the specific usage of each word better. KEKE English combines words with micro video based on daily life or popular movies, and most of the video is no more than 3 minutes, which improves the interest and memory of learning words with specific background. Meanwhile, the ways to learn words are comprehensive. There are many ways to memorize words like ‘Chinese choose English’、‘English choose Chinese’、‘fill in sentences’、‘listen to the words then choose the meaning’ and ‘dictation’. 

<div align="center"><img src="https://github.com/ECNU-DEIT-ACADEMIC-2019/Team2/blob/master/images/environment-13.jpg" height="280" width="150"/>         <img src="https://github.com/ECNU-DEIT-ACADEMIC-2019/Team2/blob/master/images/environment-14.jpg" height="280" width="150"/></div>  
   
  ####  **（3）All-round grammar**   
  ####   &#8195;&#8195;KEKE English not only contain different language rules, such as tense、voice、 mood、sentence composition、part of speech, but also covers grammar lessons at different ages and stages of knowledge. And those’re all presented it by micro video, which makes learners easy to understand.  
    
<div align="center"><img src="https://github.com/ECNU-DEIT-ACADEMIC-2019/Team2/blob/master/images/environment-15.jpg" height="180" width="480" > </div>  
<div align="center"><img src="https://github.com/ECNU-DEIT-ACADEMIC-2019/Team2/blob/master/images/environment-16.jpg" height="180" width="480" > </div>  
<div align="center"><img src="https://github.com/ECNU-DEIT-ACADEMIC-2019/Team2/blob/master/images/environment-17.jpg" height="280" width="150"/>         <img src="https://github.com/ECNU-DEIT-ACADEMIC-2019/Team2/blob/master/images/environment-18.jpg" height="280" width="150"/></div>  

   >>**2.1.2 Strengthen language skills training**   
 ####  &#8195;&#8195;Listening, speaking, reading and writing fluently and quickly is a very important skill goal for English learning. But it’s a common problem for most people to speak English bravely. KEKE English sets up some sections to train learners’ skills of listening、speaking、reading and writing, such as ‘Radio listening’, ‘Dictation training’, ‘Situational dialogue’, ‘Dictation training’, ‘Oral English show’, ‘Composition modification’ , etc. In addition, it has user-friendly mode settings, including ‘Intensive listening’, ‘Listen and repeat’, ‘Loop playback’, ‘Speed variation’. And it makes the users speak boldly and read accurately. 
  
<div align="center"><img src="https://github.com/ECNU-DEIT-ACADEMIC-2019/Team2/blob/master/images/environment-19.jpg" height="180" width="480" > </div>  
<div align="center"><img src="https://github.com/ECNU-DEIT-ACADEMIC-2019/Team2/blob/master/images/environment-20.jpg" height="300" width="300" > </div>  

####  &#8195;&#8195;What’s more, KEKE English provides a large amount of daily speaking content and a wide range of listening materials, including news, songs, sports, film and television. It helps learners understand the topic of a discussions and memorize the key points, identify different emotions expressed by different tones, use appropriate intonation and rhythm to express personal intentions in communication through different categories and topic contexts. At the same time, in order to improve the learning competence of listening, speaking, reading and writing, learners are encouraged to accumulate vocabulary of daily life, personal interest, custom, culture of science, community life, such as job, festivals, social etiquette.  

<div align="center"><img src="https://github.com/ECNU-DEIT-ACADEMIC-2019/Team2/blob/master/images/environment-21.jpg" height="280" width="150" > </div>  

   >>**2.1.3 Enhance interests in English learning**    
  ####  &#8195;&#8195;There is a big difference between Chinese and English, the improvement of cognitive level about English culture can promote the sublimation of students’ emotional attitude towards English, thus improving the English learning effect.  Through some interesting sections, like ‘Good morning English’, ‘Summer English reading’, ‘Learn English and travel around the word’, KEKE English increases learners’ knowledge of English culture. In the meanwhile, through ‘the training of nine-word puzzle’, ‘single dictation to eliminate the blind corner’, ‘back words to earn beans for gifts’ and other forms with gamification, KEKE English can stimulate the interests of learning English, so learners can improve their English learning effect.  

<div align="center"><img src="https://github.com/ECNU-DEIT-ACADEMIC-2019/Team2/blob/master/images/environment-22.jpg" height="280" width="150"/>         <img src="https://github.com/ECNU-DEIT-ACADEMIC-2019/Team2/blob/master/images/environment-23.jpg" height="280" width="150"/>     <img src="https://github.com/ECNU-DEIT-ACADEMIC-2019/Team2/blob/master/images/environment-24.jpg" height="280" width="150"/></div>  

   >>**2.2 Suggestion**  
  #### &#8195;&#8195;**(1)**  At the beginning of each level, KEKE English will present all the new words for the user to make they be familiar with before "testing". This should be changed. We think it should let users choose "know" or "don’t know" first, and then decide whether to "cross out" the word or not. Lastly, users can enter the "start test". In this way, users can not only make self-prediction, but also reduce unnecessary recitation and improve efficiency.  
 ####  &#8195;&#8195;**(2)**  Secondly, the details of the KEKE English words page just contains “Chinese explanations”, “mnemonic”, “example sentence”, which looks slightly boring. It can add “English explanations”, “picture association”, “synonyms” and other functions, so it can make the best memories.  
 ####  &#8195;&#8195;**(3)**  Thirdly, it should allow two or more types of word books to be studied at the same time. Because many exams timetable are close and need to prepare at the same time.  
  #### &#8195;&#8195;**(4)**  English pronunciation practice is only available on the official website, but not on the mobile phone. Nearly 90% of learners are using it on the mobile phone. So it should add this module on the mobile phone.

>**3 Behaviors**    
>>**3.1 Analysis**  
#### &#8195;&#8195;There were plenty of research studies shown that E-learning has been played a significant role in every aspect of students’ learning. Most of them conducted effects of E-learning by observing learner’s behaviors, like learning motivation, engagement, learning outcomes, acceptance and so on. Researchers have got a conclusion that students are more likely to be more motivated and engaged when applying E-learning platform .[6] Moreover, there are some research have shown that concept maps in the context of E-learning can be used as an effective tool to improve students learning achievement and motivation .[7]
#### &#8195;&#8195; Therefore, in this section, we focus on Behavior which is one of the key factors of E-learning platform, to analyze an English learning platform named KEKE English from the aspects of learning motivation, engagement and learning achievement and then give some advise finally.
#### (1)Motivation
#### &#8195;&#8195;motivation often be taken part into 2 types, intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. Intrinsic motivation include interests, happiness and satisfaction. Extrinsic motivation mainly include reward, peer’s inspiration and requirements of teacher.
#### &#8195;&#8195; As we can see from KEKE English apps, there are various types of learning contents from K-12 to graduate students and business workers. People can find their learning interests and suitable knowledge for different aims. For example, some people prefer listen to some ABC news or VOA to improve listening skills. some other people would read some news and stories for entertaining. User also can see the subscription numbers and pop content while not knowing what to learn. In brief, everyone can find their interests and can be motivated by its abundant and integrated contents.
<div align="center"><img src="https://github.com/ECNU-DEIT-ACADEMIC-2019/Team2/blob/master/images/behavior-1.jpg" height='500' width='350'> </div> 

#### (2)Engagement
#### &#8195;&#8195;There are some common problems existed in E-learning platform, that is the passion and engagement of student will decrease with the time goes by, then gradually give up or lose interest[8] . 
####  &#8195;&#8195;When talking about KEKE English, it encourage users to sign in and learn everyday to earn some more KEKE beans(award). This function can facilitate students’ subjective initiative(主观能动性) and improve their engagement. In addition, ranking list can form more visual images for users to make some comparison with other people and inspire or motivate users to insist.

#### (3)Learning achievement
#### &#8195;&#8195;Learning achievement is a significant dimension to analyze the effect of E-learning platform. In most cases, learner’s ultimate aim is to acquire some special knowledge or some kind of skills. Therefore, E-learning platform need to monitor or record user’s daily achievement and testing scores to give in-time reflections. 
#### &#8195;&#8195;KEKE English has a very obvious module for users to train and practice, mainly about listening skill and speaking skill. Users can practice their listening skill by watching videos, completing sentence and making multiple choice. The training results would be reflected in-time for users in order to unlock more learning contents. Specifically, the degree of difficulty would increase gradually so that users can reach to higher and higher learning performance with challenges and enjoyments. In addition, KEKE English also offer examination function for users to practice or prepare for real exam.
<div align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/ECNU-DEIT-ACADEMIC-2019/Team2/blob/master/images/behavior-4.png"  height='500' width='350' >
<img src="https://github.com/ECNU-DEIT-ACADEMIC-2019/Team2/blob/master/images/behavior-5.png"  height='500' width='350'> </div> 

#### (4) data analysis
#### &#8195;&#8195;According to this figure, it revealed that almost 92% users admitted they could have a good memory after using KEKE English. 75% users felt great enjoyment when finishing some tasks or acquire some knowledge. Most importantly, almost 66% people are quite satisfied with its learning content and context.
<div align="center"><img src="https://github.com/ECNU-DEIT-ACADEMIC-2019/Team2/blob/master/images/behavior-6.png" > </div> 

>>**3.2 Suggestions**  
#### &#8195;&#8195;Broaden examination field. At present, KEKE English examination mainly include CET-4, CTE-6, TEM-8 etc. there is a suggestion that they can add more types of examinations like GRE, SAT, TOFEL, IELTS for those who are preparing for going abroad.
####  &#8195;&#8195;Exam comprehensive ability. Comprehensive simulation examinations are really necessary for users who preparing for real context examination. So there is a suggestion for KEKE English to alter their strategies and integrate all types of question to test learner’s comprehensive ability and performance.
<div align="center"><img src="https://github.com/ECNU-DEIT-ACADEMIC-2019/Team2/blob/master/images/behavior-7.png"  height='500' width='350'> </div> 

----------------------------------------   

>**4 Interaction**    
>>**4.1 Analysis**  
#### &#8195;&#8195;The application of E-learning platform can complete the weakness of traditional class, it include two aspects of interaction. Firstly, it include human-human interaction which can highly support the interaction between teacher and student, peer to peer and all learners in online learning context, like personalized learning, collabrative learning. In addition, it also include human-machine interaction, like in-time reflection, face recognition, speech recognition etc.
In this section, we discuss manner and media of KEKE English platform including human-human interaction and human-machine interaction.
#### (1)	Manner 
#### &#8195;&#8195; When talking about the function of human-human interaction manner of KEKE English, it is important to introduce KEKE teacher app, which is a instructional tutoring system for teachers to arrange assignments, check students’ performance and give in-time reflection. This function support student and teachers to interact deeper by monitoring and reflection. In addition, in the training part, users can express their view and opinions after watching a report or video and share it in community. Moreover, in the exam-preparing column, there are many discussion group, users can find a suitable group to share their problems, experience and own opinions, in the meantime, they also can inspire and monitor each other.
<div align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/ECNU-DEIT-ACADEMIC-2019/Team2/blob/master/images/interaction-1.png"  height='500' width='350'> 
<img src="https://github.com/ECNU-DEIT-ACADEMIC-2019/Team2/blob/master/images/interaction-2.png"  height='500' width='350'> 
<img src="https://github.com/ECNU-DEIT-ACADEMIC-2019/Team2/blob/master/images/interaction-3.png"  height='500' width='350'> </div> 


#### &#8195;&#8195;Except the interaction between human and human, we also need to know the manner of human-machine. Most of the English learning platform include the function of speech recognition, so that it can support users to practice their spoken English. KEKE English also support users to train their speaking skills by repeatedly speaking out what they heard.
<div align="center"><img src="https://github.com/ECNU-DEIT-ACADEMIC-2019/Team2/blob/master/images/interaction-4.png"  height='500' width='350'> </div> 

#### (2)	Media
#### &#8195;&#8195;KEKE English has various of interactive media supporting user’s listening, writing and speaking skills. People can find any types of learning resource, like English video, radio, broadcasting station, real time news, TV music, simulated examination etc. all of these interaction media are integrated and classified clearly into different types, so that people can make a quick decision about what and how to learn.
<div align="center"><img src="https://github.com/ECNU-DEIT-ACADEMIC-2019/Team2/blob/master/images/interaction-5.png"  height='500' width='350'> </div> 

#### (3) data analysis
#### &#8195;&#8195;we can see from this figure, almost 50% people prefer ebooks and reading articles when using KEKE English platform, and then entertainment factors are secondly preferred options, mainly include talk show, speech, and documentary. Learning courses are also important for those people who have some long-term goals. While almost no one choose community learning manner for learning, it implicates that KEKE English platform should strengthen the attraction and engagement of users in learning community.
<div align="center"><img src="https://github.com/ECNU-DEIT-ACADEMIC-2019/Team2/blob/master/images/interaction-6.png" > </div>    

 ----------------------------------------   
 
   >**5 Experience**    
   >>**5.1 Analysis**  
  #### &#8195;&#8195; TheGlossary of Education Reform funded by Nellie Mae EducationFoundation defines learning experience roughly: learning experience refers to the experience generated by students' interaction with courses, teaching activities, teaching interaction and learning environment in the learning process[9].The learning experience of e-learning platform: learners' perception and reflection of the platform learning environment, learning activities, learning services, effect and many other learning elements and platform construction[10]. We used a questionnaire to investigate the functions that learners think keke English can improve their learning experience. We will combine subjective cognition and objective data to evaluate the learning experience brought by coco English from the aspects of accessibility, availability and happiness to evaluate.
 
   >>**5.1.1 Accessibility** 
  #### &#8195;&#8195; Massive learning content and covering a wide range of content. Keke English have a lots of materials about videos, articles, words bank and so on. Most of the content is free, and even paid or VIP services can earn “cocoa beans” for exchanging materials.  
  <div align="center"><img src="https://github.com/ECNU-DEIT-ACADEMIC-2019/Team2/blob/master/images/experience1.jpg" height="280" width="150" >         <img src="https://github.com/ECNU-DEIT-ACADEMIC-2019/Team2/blob/master/images/experience2.jpg" height="280" width="150" ></div>  
  
  #### &#8195;&#8195; The classification of the learning content on the homepage is detailed, and learners can choose these different materials according to the needs and purposes of learning.  
  #### &#8195;&#8195; The computer phone can synchronize the vocabulary, the collection record and the browsing history, but the learning progress of the Android system and the ios system are not synchronized. For example, the user has completed 200 levels in the Android system. After switching to the ios system, the user need to re-start from scratch, which seriously affects the user’s learning experience.  
  <div align="center"><img src="https://github.com/ECNU-DEIT-ACADEMIC-2019/Team2/blob/master/images/experience3.jpg" height="280" width="150" ></div>  
  
   #### &#8195;&#8195;The mobile phone system environment is unstable. For example, the latest version of ios can't log in the account, and sometimes this app don’t recognize the phone connected wifi.   
  #### &#8195;&#8195; However, some functions are not set to be self-contained. For example, the number of words in the task of memorizing words is set by the system, each level of 15 words, so the users cannot modify by themselves.  
    
   >>**5.1.2 Availability**   
   ####  &#8195;&#8195;The effectiveness of keke English is mainly analyzes from learning and test results and learning feedback.   
   #### &#8195;&#8195; From the comments of the software store, we find that many learners think that the content of coco English is rich in content, and can be used to train listening, speaking, reading and writing skills, in order to improve the overall English ability.  
  <div align="center"><img src="https://github.com/ECNU-DEIT-ACADEMIC-2019/Team2/blob/master/images/experience4.jpg" height="300" width="500" ></div>  
  
 ####   &#8195;&#8195; Keke English has an Intelligent English scoring system, which can test leaner’s listening and speaking skill and give scores to test their learning performance. But this test feedback system is enough, perhaps the corresponding error correction scheme should be presented here.  
   <div align="center"><img src="https://github.com/ECNU-DEIT-ACADEMIC-2019/Team2/blob/master/images/experience5.jpg" height="280" width="300" ></div>  
   
   >>**5.1.3 Happiness**  
####  &#8195;&#8195; Happiness refers to the feeling of learners during and after the learning.  
 ####  &#8195;&#8195; In this respect, keke English has set up an incentive mechanism to help learners enhance their sense of achievement in learning. For example, after going though mission twice, the user can punch the card to earn “cocoa beans”, which can be used to exchange VIP, courses and so on. In addition, users can view the ranking from the list and interact with other users, which can stimulate their desire to challenge and promote continuous learning.  
 #### &#8195;&#8195; In terms of content settings, coco English set a lot of interesting learning materials. Such as, radio blogs, bilingual video, movies and songs. Thses can attract learners' attention through speech skills and video music, and improve the happiness of the learning process to enhance the learning effect.  
  <div align="center"><img src="https://github.com/ECNU-DEIT-ACADEMIC-2019/Team2/blob/master/images/experience6.jpg" height="280" width="300" ></div>  
   
   >>**5.2 Suggestion**  
  #### &#8195;&#8195; We have also conducted a questionnaire survey on the user's learning experience. The above are the directions in which learners think keke English will reduce their learning experience. Based on these directions and the analysis of our group, the following Suggestions are given.  
   <div align="center"><img src="https://github.com/ECNU-DEIT-ACADEMIC-2019/Team2/blob/master/images/experience7.jpg" height="300" width="800" ></div>  
   
   >>**5.2.1 strengthen the part that users can set**
#### &#8195;&#8195;  Because each person's learning ability and habits are different, so it is suggested the maximum degree of autonomy, let learners set learning plan, so that learners can control the learning progress by themselves.  
   
   >>**5.2.2 ensure a stable environment**   
#### &#8195;&#8195;  In this respect, keke English is required to test the system environment, and fix various bugs such as flashback, cotton and so on.  
   
   >>**5.2.3 optimize interface design**   
 #### &#8195;&#8195; There is a lot of learning content and enter windows. However, from the survey, there are still a quarter of people think that the interface design of kek English is not friendly, which is related to the excessive resources and the multiple and disorderly functions of the home page. The functions of keke English can be classified on the home page, which will make the learners look more clear at a glance.  
   
   >>**5.2.4 feedback method** 
#### &#8195;&#8195;  The testing mechanism of keke English is very simple. We suggest giving learners some Suggestions after the test to help them further improve.

>**6 interact objectt**    
   >>**6.1 Analysis**     
#### &#8195;&#8195;  The interaction objects of e-learning platform are divided into human-computer interaction and human-human interaction. These two interaction modes are very necessary and irreplaceable. In this chapter, we combine the questionnaire survey of learners on interaction to evaluate the functional characteristics of human-machine interaction and human-human interaction, and give some useful Suggestions.  
  
   >>**6.1.1 human-machine interaction** 
#### &#8195;&#8195;  The main technology in human-machine interaction is speech recognition, which is used to identify learners' spoken language and give scores. Keke English let students to choose the degree of difficulty, purpose of learning etc, and recommend learning resources suitable for learners’ level according to these options. But for keke English in terms of human-machine interaction, its unilateral output of knowledge is more, and its design of keke English is less.

   >>**6.1.2 human-human interaction**   
 #### &#8195;&#8195;  In the part of human-human interaction, The main interaction objects are teachers and similar learners in keke English. Interaction with teachers mainly use the function of class. Interaction with learners frequently use discussion groups and dynamic to interact. These functions can simulate the real classroom environment.  
#### &#8195;&#8195;  The function of class is expounded in the section of interaction, so that won't be covered again here. In the learner interaction, learners can discuss relevant knowledge in a discussion group, which is the same as forum. Dynamic is similar to WeChat circle of friends, which is used to show the results after punching in. However, the dynamic function only opens the "like" function, and cannot comment.  
<div align="center"><img src="https://github.com/ECNU-DEIT-ACADEMIC-2019/Team2/blob/master/images/interact object3.jpg" height="280" width="150" ></div>  

 #### &#8195;&#8195; According to the results of the questionnaire, keke English has a relatively poor design of interaction. Sixty percent had little or no interaction, and those who interacted had a "average" attitude about its function.  
 <div align="center">

  <img src="https://github.com/ECNU-DEIT-ACADEMIC-2019/Team2/blob/master/images/interact object5.jpg" height="200" width="530" ></div>
   
   >>**6.2 Suggestion**  
   >>**6.2.1 add the function of comment**  
####  &#8195;&#8195; the effect of user interaction in the "dynamic" function is not obvious enough. Comment function can be added to enable users who have taken the same course to have two-way communication.   
   
   >>**6.2.2 increase interactive encouragement mechanism**  
####  &#8195;&#8195; For example, for encouraging learners to interact and creating a positive learning atmosphere, cocoa beans can be awarded to learners who have received more than 20 likes.
