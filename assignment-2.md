### 2 About recruit model
#### Environment
&#8195;&#8195; Learners can start and complete their learning and practice wherever or whenever they want in recruit model by Qushuojingying application. They just need to use their smart phone and connect with WIFI to download our Qushuojingying application. We consider that environment include the factors of interact object and interaction. Because both of the interact object and interaction appeared in our typical application and support user to interact.

#### Knowledge, Skills, Attitude
&#8195;&#8195; Knowledge: Learners go through various levels, including classroom, office, hospital and other scenarios to learn oral communication vocabulary, special grammar, specific expression sentence patterns, as well as mouth and pronunciation standards.

&#8195;&#8195; Skills: Learners practice in a variety of scenarios such as classroom, office, hospital and so on, to improve their speaking and listening skills.

&#8195;&#8195; Attitude: Learners overcome the psychological pressure of "difficult to speak" and develop a sense of courage in fluent oral communication on nervous occasions. And also learners will build confidence in speaking and learning English.

#### Experience
&#8195;&#8195; Through continuous behavioral reinforcement, the memory of pronunciation, mouth shapes and intonation can be acquired, as well as the memory of listening, speaking and watching in different oral communication scenes. In addition, the operational memory can be formed by continuous use of our Qushuojingying software. In addition, learners will feel a sense of accomplishment after completing each level, which further stimulates learners’ interest and motivation to continue to learn oral English.

### 3 About optional model
#### &#8195;&#8195;optional model (自选模式) is based on the theory of constructivism, which emphasize collaboration with real people or machine to build and construct new knowledge. 
#### Knowledge
&#8195;&#8195; In the dialogue mode of human-to-human, learners can choose scenarios and set specific roles independently, which creates conditions for learners' knowledge accumulation and skill upgrading, such as English speaking ability , cooperative skills, communication skills, problem solving skills, creativity and critical thinking skills. Pre-knowledge and Social interaction (including Interactive process, interactive experience, knowledge interaction) are the key elements of knowledge meaning construction. Based on the existing knowledge and experience in Oral English practice, learners re-understand and re-construct the meaning of knowledge in the process of social interaction, so as to construct new knowledge.  
#### Behavior  
&#8195;&#8195; The inner knowledge will manifest as explicit behavior, which is also the observable learning performance. In situational oral English practice, if the learner has completed the meaningful knowledge construction, then he will speak loudly, fluently and quickly in the following oral English-speaking practice, even in their real life. Otherwise, he will practice it again and again to gain the knowledge or skills effectively.  
#### Post Experience  
&#8195;&#8195; The memory formed by learners' practical experience in t the dialogue mode of human-to-human is also the core element of oral English learning, such as the memory of the speed, intonation and tone of oral English in different scenes or the expression and action of speech. At the same time, emotional experiences such as confidence and joy gained from such interactions are also important.　For example, if the learner completes the task well, he/she will be more interested in oral English learning and be more motivated to complete the following learning tasks and challenges.　This kind of learning experience, in terms of interactive information and result transformation, will ultimately affect learners.  
#### Conclusion  
&#8195;&#8195; In summary, we can analyze oral English learning from the perspective of constructivism like these: First, learners enter into activities with their pre-knowledge; then the learner choose specific situations and virtual characters, becoming a member of the social interaction group. During the process of dialoguing with team member, existing knowledge between different learners constantly collides, learners and virtual English learning situations are gradually integrated, a meaningful knowledge construction within each learner is formed.
