## <center> Analysis of Qushuojingying English </center>
### 1 Brief introduction
#### &#8195;&#8195;Qushuoyingyu is an application which can satisfy your need of English speaking. It is divided into two models, one is the recruit model and the other is the optional model. 
<div align="center"><img src="https://github.com/ECNU-DEIT-ACADEMIC-2019/Team2/blob/master/KIEBIE-for-final-project/images/application's%20framework.png" height="545" width="771" > </div>  
&#8195;&#8195;In the recruit model, the user first needs to select a practical situation in spoken English, such as a supermarket, a hospital, a company, a school or a bus stop or any other situations. After the situation selection, the user can conduct an English conversation with the machine as if they were in that place. Based on the user's spoken performance, this application will give them a score. It is like an exam. If their score is high enough, they pass the exam and get an access to the human to human mode. His spoken partner’s level is well-matched with him. Unluckily, if they fail, they will practice with the machine one more time.

&#8195;&#8195;In the optional model, it is divided into two modes which are the human to human mode and the human-machine mode. In human to human mode, this application has a function of communicating with foreign teachers, which is a paid function. We can also choose the free one, selecting a communication situation such as hospital, and matching a partner to communication. In order to learn English more freely, you can also select to practice with machine.

### 2 About recruit model
#### &#8195;&#8195;Recruit model（闯关模式）is based on the theory of behaviourism. whose process is  that through repeated English conversation training. Behavior is firstly affected, and then through frequent intensive training, knowledge and experience are constructed.

#### Environment  
&#8195;&#8195;Learners can start and complete their learning and practice wherever or whenever they want in recruit model by Qushuojingying application. They just need to use their smart phone and connect with WIFI to download our Qushuojingying application. We consider that environment include the factors of interact object and interaction. Because both of the interact object and interaction appeared in our typical application and support user to interact.  

#### Interact object
&#8195;&#8195;in the recruit model, the object of interaction with learner is mainly machines. Learners through continuous dialogue with the machine, to complete the task.  

#### Interaction
&#8195;&#8195;the human-machine interaction includes dialogue, watching, touching etc. through this element, learner can receive stimulus (level and ranking) from machine.  

#### Behavior
&#8195;&#8195;in the theory of behaviourism, due to repeated training, the first element to be changed is behavior. In the app, when learners practice a content repeatedly, their dialogue patterns and pronunciation will gradually form a specific behavior of their own. In the line from interaction to behavior, the learner's reaction corresponding to the stimulus is completing the task. And in this process, the reaction will have a certain degree of influence on the behavior. as the final part of the loop, the feedback training scores from machine will help learner further strengthen.  

#### Knowledge, Skills, Attitude
&#8195;&#8195; Knowledge: Learners go through various levels, including classroom, office, hospital and other scenarios to learn oral communication vocabulary, special grammar, specific expression sentence patterns, as well as mouth and pronunciation standards.

&#8195;&#8195; Skills: Learners practice in a variety of scenarios such as classroom, office, hospital and so on, to improve their speaking and listening skills.

&#8195;&#8195; Attitude: Learners overcome the psychological pressure of "difficult to speak" and develop a sense of courage in fluent oral communication on nervous occasions. And also learners will build confidence in speaking and learning English.

#### Experience
&#8195;&#8195; Through continuous behavioral reinforcement, the memory of pronunciation, mouth shapes and intonation can be acquired, as well as the memory of listening, speaking and watching in different oral communication scenes. In addition, the operational memory can be formed by continuous use of our Qushuojingying software. In addition, learners will feel a sense of accomplishment after completing each level, which further stimulates learners’ interest and motivation to continue to learn oral English.


&#8195;&#8195;In general, the recruit model based on behaviorism learning theory is using level as a stimulus to let learners conduct repeated training, and taking the completion of task as a reaction to achieve the purpose of constructing new behaviors. Afterwards, in the process of continuous feedback and consolidation, learners can internalize and form their own knowledge construction.   

### 3 About optional model
#### &#8195;&#8195;optional model (自选模式) is based on the theory of constructivism, which emphasize collaboration with real people or machine to build and construct new knowledge.

#### Environment
&#8195;&#8195; People can complete their learning and practice wherever they are. they only need to use their smart phone and connect with WIFI to download our application. We consider that environment include the factors of interact object and interaction. Because both the interact object and interaction appeared in our typical application and support user to interact.
#### About user
&#8195;&#8195; everyone has pre-knowledge before they start to use our application to learn. For example, speaking skill and listening skill already existed in their memory.
#### Interact object
&#8195;&#8195; In the optional mode, users can choose to interact with real people or machine, so there are human-human interact object or human-machine interact object.
#### Experience
&#8195;&#8195; Within the interaction and communication process, users can produce some experience like feeling of communication and collaboration with co-peer, which would integrate with their pre-knowledge and memory to impact their next interaction and collaboration process.
#### Knowledge
&#8195;&#8195; In the dialogue mode of human-to-human, learners can choose scenarios and set specific roles independently, which creates conditions for learners' knowledge accumulation and skill upgrading, such as English speaking ability , cooperative skills, communication skills, problem solving skills, creativity and critical thinking skills. Pre-knowledge and Social interaction (including Interactive process, interactive experience, knowledge interaction) are the key elements of knowledge meaning construction. Based on the existing knowledge and experience in Oral English practice, learners re-understand and re-construct the meaning of knowledge in the process of social interaction, so as to construct new knowledge.  
#### Behavior  
&#8195;&#8195; The inner knowledge will manifest as explicit behavior, which is also the observable learning performance. In situational oral English practice, if the learner has completed the meaningful knowledge construction, then he will speak loudly, fluently and quickly in the following oral English-speaking practice, even in their real life. Otherwise, he will practice it again and again to gain the knowledge or skills effectively.  
#### Post Experience  
&#8195;&#8195; The memory formed by learners' practical experience in t the dialogue mode of human-to-human is also the core element of oral English learning, such as the memory of the speed, intonation and tone of oral English in different scenes or the expression and action of speech. At the same time, emotional experiences such as confidence and joy gained from such interactions are also important.　For example, if the learner completes the task well, he/she will be more interested in oral English learning and be more motivated to complete the following learning tasks and challenges.　This kind of learning experience, in terms of interactive information and result transformation, will ultimately affect learners.  
#### Conclusion  
&#8195;&#8195; In summary, we can analyze oral English learning from the perspective of constructivism like these: First, learners enter into activities with their pre-knowledge; then the learner choose specific situations and virtual characters, becoming a member of the social interaction group. During the process of dialoguing with team member, existing knowledge between different learners constantly collides, learners and virtual English learning situations are gradually integrated, a meaningful knowledge construction within each learner is formed.
