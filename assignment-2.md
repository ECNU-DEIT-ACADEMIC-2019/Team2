### 3 About optional model
#### &#8195;&#8195;optional model (自选模式) is based on the theory of constructivism, which emphasize collaboration with real people or machine to build and construct new knowledge. 
#### Knowledge
&#8195;&#8195; In the dialogue mode of human-to-human, learners can choose scenarios and set specific roles independently, which creates conditions for learners' knowledge accumulation and skill upgrading, such as English speaking ability , cooperative skills, communication skills, problem solving skills, creativity and critical thinking skills. Pre-knowledge and Social interaction (including Interactive process, interactive experience, knowledge interaction) are the key elements of knowledge meaning construction. Based on the existing knowledge and experience in Oral English practice, learners re-understand and re-construct the meaning of knowledge in the process of social interaction, so as to construct new knowledge.  
#### Behavior  
&#8195;&#8195; The inner knowledge will manifest as explicit behavior, which is also the observable learning performance. In situational oral English practice, if the learner has completed the meaningful knowledge construction, then he will speak loudly, fluently and quickly in the following oral English-speaking practice, even in their real life. Otherwise, he will practice it again and again to gain the knowledge or skills effectively.
