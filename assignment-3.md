#### Confidence_Intervals Sheet

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Confidence level is equal to 95%, the corresponding Z value is 1.96. The calculation formula of standard error is SE=(Std.Dev.)/√N ，Confidence is equal to SE\*1.96, and Confidence interval is equal to mean-confidence to Mean+Confidence.
For example, in Item1 of the first line of Confidence_Intervals Sheet, if the confidence level is equal to 95%, the corresponding Z value is 1.96, the calculation formula of standard error is SE=1.472/√30=0.269 , SE\*1.96=0.527, and the corresponding confidence interval is 0.273\~1.327. It indicates that when there is another sample, there is a 95% probability of appearing in the range 0.273\~1.327.
